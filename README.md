3D Equationion Grapher
-------------------

## Summary

The goal of this project is to make a clear, visual, 3D graph to make graphing lines and inequalities easier to see and understand.
The library used is a lightweight 3D engine called Three.JS

## Usage

Near the top of the screen you will see place in put input. In the profit/z axis put what you want the z axis to equal, or, if you dont care about the z axis, put 0

In the box below type your equation(s)/inequalitie(s). If you have multiple equation(s)/inequalitie(s) seperate them by either and or or.
